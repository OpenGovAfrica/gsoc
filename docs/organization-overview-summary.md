# OpenGov Africa â€“ Overview & Mission

OpenGov Africa is a civic technology organization advancing transparency, accountability, and digital inclusion across the African continent. Our mission is to empower citizens, civil society, and public institutions through open data, participatory governance, and ethical technology.

We operate at the intersection of technology and civic engagement, building open-source solutions that make governments more transparent and citizens more empowered. Our work focuses on three pillars:

- **Civic Technology:** developing accessible digital tools that enable citizens to participate directly in decision-making and governance.  
- **Transparency & Accountability:** promoting open data standards, tracking public spending, and supporting anti-corruption initiatives.  
- **Digital Inclusion:** bridging the connectivity gap through low-bandwidth, multilingual, and mobile-first solutions that reach underserved communities.

Through our projects and partnerships, OpenGov Africa has supported civic innovators, strengthened public participation, and fostered collaboration between technologists and policymakers. By combining open-source principles with a deep understanding of African governance challenges, we create technology that drives trust, participation, and equitable access to information.
