# Evaluation Criteria

This document outlines the evaluation process for student submissions and project progress in Google Summer of Code (GSoC), including grading criteria and review metrics.

## Evaluation Phases

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) includes two formal evaluation phases to review contributor progress and project quality. These ensure that the project stays on track and meets its objectives. Evaluations are completed by both the contributor and mentor through the GSoC web app.

### 1. Midterm Evaluation
**Purpose**: 
Assess contributor progress midway through the coding period and ensure active communication.

**Timing**:
* Standard projects: After 6 weeks (of 12).
* Short projects: After 4 weeks (of 8).
* Dates are listed in the official [GSoC timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

**Contributor’s Midterm Evaluation**:
1. Summary of work completed so far.
2. Current progress and remaining tasks.
3. Challenges faced and resolutions.
4. Plan for the next phase.
5. Communication and learning reflections.

**Mentor’s Midterm Evaluation**:

Mentors assess based on:
* Progress toward goals
* Communication consistency
* Code quality and independenceResult:
* Pass: Continue to second half.
* Fail: Program ends and no further stipend.

### 2. Final Evaluation
**Purpose**:
Evaluate final deliverables, documentation, and overall performance. Passing marks successful completion and official GSoC alumnus status.

**Timing**:
* Standard projects: After 12 weeks.
* Short projects: After 8 weeks.
* Must be submitted before the deadline — missing it = automatic failure.

**Contributor’s Final Evaluation**:
1. Summary of completed work (include links to code/docs).
2. Challenges encountered and how they were solved.
3. Key learnings.
4. Project impact and future contribution plans.
5. Feedback on mentors and organization.

**Mentor’s Final Evaluation**:

Mentors evaluate:
* Goal completion and deliverables
* Code quality and professionalism
* Communication and independenceResult:
* Pass: Successfully completed GSoC.
* Fail: Did not meet expectations.

## How Evaluations Work
* Both mentor and contributor complete a short (10–15 min) online form.
* Evaluations focus on project progress, communication, and collaboration.
* Visibility:
    * Most responses → only Google admins
    * Some mentor-related questions → org admins
    * Rarely, details may be shared if issues (e.g., payment) arise.
* Results: Pass/fail notifications are emailed to the contributor, mentor, and org admins.
* Requirement: Final evaluation is mandatory — missing it results in failure and no stipend.

## Grading Details
* Pass: Met/exceeded expectations; milestones completed; quality code and communication.
* Fail: Insufficient progress, communication, or quality.

## Stipend & Certification
* Midterm payment: ~45% after passing midterm.
* Final payment: ~55% after passing final evaluation.
* Successful contributors receive a Completion Certificate and become GSoC Alumni.
