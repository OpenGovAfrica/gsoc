# GSoC Program Ideas

OpenGov Africa is preparing to apply as a **Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026 Mentoring Organization**.

This page presents a curated set of **mission-aligned, Africa-first proposed project ideas** that reflect OpenGov Africa’s core mandate:  
**leveraging open data, open-source technologies, and civic innovation to strengthen transparency, accountability, and citizen participation across African governance systems.**

These ideas are intentionally grounded in **real political, social, and institutional realities on the continent**—from elections and public finance to civic space, protests, and digital rights.

Project ideas may evolve based on mentor input, contributor feedback, and feasibility discussions. Community members interested in mentoring are encouraged to propose refinements or entirely new ideas aligned with our mission.

The table below outlines **proposed GSoC 2026 project ideas** for OpenGov Africa.  
All projects are aligned with our mission to advance **open governance, transparency, accountability, civic participation, and digital rights across Africa**.

You do not need to be a “perfect” expert—commitment, clarity, and context-awareness matter more.

## Next Steps

- Interested mentors should signal interest and propose project ideas 
- Contributors are encouraged to engage early with discussions and starter tasks  
- Final project list will be published as part of our GSoC application  

OpenGov Africa is building **for citizens, by citizens, with open technology**.  
If this resonates with you, we invite you to help shape what comes next.


**Note:**  
All projects are subject to refinement based on mentor availability, feasibility within the GSoC timeline, and community feedback. OpenGov Africa prioritizes ethical development, political context awareness, and citizen impact.
